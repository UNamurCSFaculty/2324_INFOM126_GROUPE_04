## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Guestbook Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started
Before you can make any contribution, please set up your local environment and get familiar with the development workflow. Please refer to our [Setup Guide](SETUP_GUIDE.md) for instructions on how to get started.

## Reporting Bugs
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname/issues/new); it's that easy!

Before you file a bug report, please check to make sure it hasn't already been reported. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the [required template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

## Feature Requests
We're always looking for suggestions to improve our project. If you have an idea for something you think would be a good addition, please open an issue using our [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) to let us know.

## Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Update the documentation as necessary.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Coding Standards
We strive to maintain a consistent coding style, so we ask that you adhere to the following rules:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs.
- Write clean, understandable, and maintainable code.
- Follow the [Python PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide.

## Commit Messages
We follow a rough convention for commit messages designed to read like a sentence when viewed in the log:

- Begin the message with a verb (e.g., "Add feature to...", "Fix issue with...", "Refactor code in...").
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

## Additional Notes
Contributions should not include any offensive or inappropriate content. We reserve the right to reject any contributions that we do not deem to be in alignment with the project's goals or code of conduct.

Thank you for contributing to the Guestbook project! We look forward to your contributions.
