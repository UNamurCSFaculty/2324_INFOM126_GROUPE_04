# Code of Conduct

We are committed to building a community where everyone is safe from harassment and discrimination. 

## Anti-Harassment Statement

We condemn all forms of harassment and discrimination. Our community will not tolerate any behavior that intimidates or hurts anyone.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting us at "report_conduct@guestbook.com" . All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report, please include:

- Your contact information.
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well.
- Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record, please include a link.
- Any additional information that may be helpful.

After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond.
